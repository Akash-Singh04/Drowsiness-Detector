# Drowsiness Detector
## About The Project

The increasing prevalence of drowsy driving incidents necessitates the development of an intelligent system that can proactively identify signs of driver fatigue. The absence of a robust and efficient drowsiness detection technology hinders the prevention of accidents caused by drowsy drivers.

So what we come up with is a drowsy face detector that can track peoples eyes and based on this tells if he/she is drowsy or not in real time and give then a audio alert to wake up. Further more it can also tell give a detailed report of trip after the journey

## Getting Started
Just go ahead and clone this repo on you local system and follow the steps below :)

### Prerequisites

To host this on your local system you need.
* Keras
* Flask
* Tensorflow
* pygame
* Matplotlib
  
  ```sh
  pip install keras tensorflow flask flask_bootstrap pygame matplotlib
  ```

### Usage

Just run the app.py and follow the link on the terminal!

## Future Scope

We are planning to have two implementations of this product: one for B2C and the other for B2B. For B2B, we are planning a standalone device named SleepSense (pitched in the presentation). And for B2C, we are planning to extend SleepSense for a fleet of commercial vehicles, incorporating analytics and an admin panel.
